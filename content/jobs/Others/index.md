About 10 years ago, at 25, I decided to go back to my technical foundations, and stopped my career in commercial 
financial services to persuit an Engineering degree (best decision ever), so other relevant positions I've had in not so recent times: 

- Financial Planner at Old Mutual 
- Commercial Banker at Citi
- Insurance Broker at MetLife
